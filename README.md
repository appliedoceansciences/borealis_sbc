This repository is a rough port of [https://github.com/bristlemouth/bm_serial/blob/develop/circuitpython/bm_serial.py] to generic Python that will run on a Raspberry Pi or macOS using the system Python, with an OS-level exclusive lock around the UART access, such that multiple processes on the Pi can send messages to the Bristlemouth ecosystem via the `serial_bridge` functionality on an attached Mote.
